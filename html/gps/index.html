		<li>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The HTML5 semantic tags are used to create a clearer structure for your HTML. The tags help make the code more readable for the programmer and the search engines.
				I prefer the nav, header, and footer tags. They are most likely to be the same across most sites and allow me to quickly decipher what's going on with the code.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Left to right, top to bottom.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</li>
		<ul>
			<li>I learned how Sublime implements its snippets and now I think I may have an idea why my html snippet doesn't work by default. I don't currently use Sublime, and I don't have much interest in creating snippets in my editor of choice.
				I prefer to learn how to utilize tools that other people have created as I think that would save time and allow me to focus on programming my own project.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?</li>
		<ul>
			<li>I didn't feel challenged very much in this module. The biggest issue I felt was trying to track down Sublime's documentation on snippets.</li>
