<p>Here's a group of people who seem to have a little bit of knowledge about space.</p>
<p>Their <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">website</a> is very well-designed visually, but they could improve their page load time.
The page downloads about 10 megabytes and takes about 10 seconds to finish loading. They load almost all the content via Ajax 
after the base html has loaded.</p>
<p>I'm aware of many of the HTML elements on page. Some of the included meta properties were new to me. Which after googling, I
    disovered they are used by the <a href="http://ogp.me/">Open Graph</a> protocol. It allows social media websites to easily
    describe the page that is being shared.</p>
